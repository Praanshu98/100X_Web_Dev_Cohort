00:37:08	Anoop Nagaraj:	Why do you consider episode as an entity? Shouldn’t the higher level of it, like a TV show be an entity instead? 

Or is it because they “track” the episode drops and hence becomes an entity as it is important for streaming app?
00:37:51	MJ Felix (Mindset Theory):	So here there is a dedicated table for episodes
00:38:13	MJ Felix (Mindset Theory):	Cost of retrieval

1 to many relationship

relationship between 2 entity so tweets would be an attribute but as a foreign key
00:46:38	Sourav P:	Replying to "just a doubt, can ..."

but we can consider it as a Attribute as it is related to user.

00:52:29	Anoop Nagaraj:	Entity diagrams I’m assuming will evolve over time and not a setting stone, right? As the company scales / add new features?

00:53:30	Kshitij:	How to figure out entity in a web app?
00:53:40	Priyank Sevak:	What can be used to describe the entity is an attributes. If that attribute itself needs to have its own metadata or additional value it can be converted to entity
